Communication Skills
--------------------

Interacting with teachers at the Politecnico di Milano university, especially during project presentations, I learned to plan my speech in advance, to properly breathe during presentations, and to give the right weight to vowel, and consonants.
This skill is not good as it was, due to lack of practice.

Organisational / managerial skills
----------------------------------

The work done for Cap Gemini, 4ur, and Prima Vera put me in a leadership position in small groups of varying sizes (2, 1, and 6 respectively) granting me respect even from people that was not respected by the previous coordinators.

Job-related skills
------------------

In most of the jobs I had to think out of the box, mostly because of omissions, or errors in documentation provided by team leaders, or software providers, but also (in two cases) because of sabotage.
