Hello, my name is Marco Buschini. I am a software developer, and engineer. I am living and working in northern Italy.

Yes, you are right, working in Italy is not nice at all: I have accomplished a lot, but I lost way more.
This is the reason I am posting my personal information here on GitHub Pages.

I want to develop software tools that work for the people using them.
I want to work in a cohesive team.
I want to acquire new skills, and I am at my best when I help the team I belong to grow, solving both technical, and human problems.

Go on, and have a look at my [curriculum vitae](curriculum.html), or jump to my [GitHub user page](https://www.github.com/marcobuschini).
