About Me
========

Hello, my name is Marco Buschini. I am a software developer, and engineer. I am living and working in northern Italy.

Yes, you are right, working in Italy is not nice at all: I have accomplished a lot, but I lost way more.
This is the reason I am posting my personal information here on GitHub Pages.

Professional Interests
======================

I want to develop software tools that work for the people using them.
I want to work in a cohesive team.
I want to acquire new skills, and I am at my best when I help the team I belong to grow, solving both technical, and human problems.

Go on, and have a look at my [curriculum vitae](curriculum.html), or jump to my [GitHub user page](https://www.github.com/marcobuschini).

Personal Interests
==================

I always had a wide set of interests in my life, but I had to slim the list down due to lack of time and/or money.

I like video games, but a gaming computer is too expensive.
Now, thanks to Google Stadia and broadband I have too many games to play, and I like it a lot.
Playing with other people is the best!

I like good food, and thanks to a few TV networks (including Food Network) I am learning to cook better.

I always liked TV series, and now thanks to Amazon Prime I have, again, too many to watch.

I always liked puzzles, and riddles, and software development is full of them (I will learn to solve the Rubik's Cube sooner or later).

I like people.

I always liked writing short stories, but having tried that path in Italy when I was unemployed has been terrible.

Other keywords: fantasy, sci-fy, science, atheism, equal rights, watching woodturning on YouTube.
